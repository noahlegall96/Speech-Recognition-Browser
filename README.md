# Speech-Recognition-Browser
COMP 580 
Created by: Nina Joseph, Yan Ren, and Noah Legall (students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).

Our project looks to combine voice recognition algorithms with webdriver automation technology Selenium to make the process of web-surfing hands free. This project will provide a speech mediated interface to interact with web browsers. 

This project was designed to enhance the web surfing ability of individuals who are traditionally unable to  use a keyboard to navigate webpages. Even though this project can be utilized by anyone that can use their voice, this project can be greatly appreciated by people who canâ€™t use their fingers or arms in the way necessary to operate a keyboard for web services. People who have difficulty with fine motor movements could also benefit greatly from this project. They would be able to navigate the internet quickly and efficiently as opposed to having to struggle through the process of operating a keyboard. The ability to access the internet and operate a web browser allows the user to benefit from the vast base of tools with which the internet provides its users. While many take the ability to operate a web browser for granted, those who struggle to do so lack these abilities; by enabling individuals who struggle to use a keyboard to still operate a web browser, this project will greatly benefit this population.


Selenium is a software commonly used by companies for Quality Assurance testing. Tests are written which are used to ensure that web features still work following website updates by mimicking a user interacting with the website. This project will leverage this tool and its ability to act on a website as a user would in order to allow the voice input to be translated into actions a user could perform using the keyboard directly.
