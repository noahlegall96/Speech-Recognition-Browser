Selenium is a software commonly used by companies for Quality Assurance testing. Tests are written which are used to ensure that web features still work following website updates by mimicking a user interacting with the website. This project will leverage this tool and its ability to act on a website as a user would in order to allow the voice input to be translated into actions a user could perform using the keyboard directly.
